# LostChapterFrontend

## Project Description

	Lost Chapter is the last online bookstore website you’ll need. Users can buy or rent 
	books from various spans of published year, genre, categories, authors, and editions. 
	The lost chapter offers books in hardcover, softcover, and even Ebooks. Users can register 
	and create an account. 	Lost Chapter is attentive in their marketing and occasionally has 
	sale and deal periods. Users can pay online for their books through the website. 

    Users may also list their own items up for auction, and bid on other user’s items. 
	On our welcome page, users will be able to see a list of featured items and items that currently 
	have a sale. When purchasing items, users can select a quantity of items they would like. 
	Additionally, admins may log in and mark certain items for sale. They may also post new products 
	on the website for regular users to buy.
